    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
<h2> What is your Website About</h2>
<p> CrossFit has been a rapidly growing sport over the past 2 decades. Created by Greg Glassmnan in the year 2000, Crossfit promotes fitness through olympic style lifts, gymnastics, cardio and everything in between. My Website will be about the ins and outs of Crossfit and will feature WODs, Athlete spotlights, gear and equipment reviews and recommendations, an equipment store, and a history page to name a few.

</p>>
<h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>
<p> The objective of my website is to highlight the sport of Crossfit and allow it to gain greater exposure. It will educate about the sport, provide workouts and tips, as well as allow Crossfit members to see top notch product reviews to allow them to make informed purchasing decisions

<h4>Who is your target audience?</h4>
<p>My target audience is athletes and active individuals who have anywhere from expert knowledge to no exposure at all to Crossfit. My website will both provide information that will appeal to high level athletes as well as those who are looking to get into the sport for the first time ever</p>

<h5>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h5>
